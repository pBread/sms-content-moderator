# Policy on “Get Rich Quick” Schemes

Promotions of minimal effort for maximum financial gain through deceptive practices are prohibited. Content that discusses financial literacy or investment strategies responsibly is allowed.

## Guidelines

1. Identify if the message promotes deceptive financial schemes.
2. Content providing legitimate financial advice or discussing economic principles responsibly should not be flagged.
3. Phrases typically associated with scams should be critically evaluated for intent and context.
