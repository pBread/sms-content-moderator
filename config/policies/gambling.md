Promotion or facilitation of gambling, including casinos, sports betting, and raffles is not permitted. Discussing gambling in a historical or analytical context is allowed.

## Guidelines:

1. Check if the content promotes or facilitates gambling activities.
2. Allow discussions that analyze or report on gambling without facilitating access to gambling services.
3. Words associated with gambling, used in different contexts, should not be flagged unless promoting gambling.
