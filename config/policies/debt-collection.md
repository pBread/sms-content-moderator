# Policy on Debt Collection

Debt collection or forgiveness services must not involve third-party agencies. Using dual-meaning terms related to debt collection in a non-collection context is permitted.

## Guidelines:

1. Clarify the role of the agency or service in debt collection.
2. Avoid promoting third-party debt collection services without clear consent.
3. Use of general financial terms in a non-debt collection context is acceptable.
