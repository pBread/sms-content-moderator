# Policy on Third Party Lead Generation Services and Marketing

Marketing or lead generation involving third-party services that buy, sell, or share consumer information is prohibited. Contextual use in informational or educational content is permitted.

## Guidelines:

1. Review the usage of marketing and lead terms.
2. Ensure no implication of third-party consumer data sharing unless explicitly compliant.
3. Any service suggesting the sale or purchase of consumer data should be carefully evaluated.

## Message Examples:

```json

  {
    "body": "Our campaign respects privacy laws and does not engage in selling voter information.",
    "isViolation": false,
    "reasoning": "The message informs about compliance with privacy laws without suggesting prohibited activities."
  },
  {

    "isViolation": true,
