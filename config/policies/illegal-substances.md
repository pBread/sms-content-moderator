# Policy on Illegal Substances

The promotion or sale of illegal substances such as cannabis, CBD, and Kratom is prohibited. Use of words like "CBD" are not necessarily prohibited.

## Guidelines:

1. Distinguish between promotion/sale and educational or journalistic content.
2. Flag direct promotions or sales of restricted substances.
3. Allow discussions that are historical, legal, or medical without promoting use.
